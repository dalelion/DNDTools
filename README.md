## Introduction

Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. 
Tabletop games usually take a lot of time and require players to physically be there. 

Therefore, we’re designing a D&D online version that support the game so players can access the game anywhere anytime.

On-top of allowing for online play, our product will enable DM’s and Players to keep track mamy of the different stats, story-points and monster encounters that they come across during each play session.

This tool will allow for more connection between a DM and their players than every was possible before.
